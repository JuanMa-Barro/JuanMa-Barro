Hi everyone ğŸ‘‹,

I am a full-stack web developer from Malaga, Spain. TocotÃ³! ğŸ’ƒ

ğŸŒ± I create experiences through the websites I build, using various dark arts (JavaScript, React, Node, SQL, and brewing caffeinic potions...).

âš¡ I love art, laughing, writing, solving puzzles, and making games. And of course, I enjoy spending time outdoors and living life to the fullest.

ğŸ“§ How to reach me: juanmabarrosantos84@gmail.com  or  Linkedin
